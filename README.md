This is a simple little website to practice using git branches and incremental development.Not really simple website!

Can you replicate it exactly?  Not just the code, but the branches and commits!

Learning to create and merge branches is only the beginning.  The trickier and more important skill is lining up your branches with the steps of incremental development.

If you're having trouble visualizingkkkkkkkk the branches in this repository, try taking a look at [the network visualization](https://help.github.com/en/articles/viewing-a-repositorys-network) in the "insights" tab. *This part helped me*

But wait!  How are forks different from branches?  It's true that these are very similar, but the difference is important.
* Forks allow different github users to store their own copy of an entire GitHub repository and work on the project without effecting the main repository.
* Branches allow one user to make changes in their repository (fork) without effecting the master branch.

So a simple way to understand the difference at first is that forks have the same purpose as branches, but at a higher level.
* Repositories are cloned: when you clone a repository from GitHub it will copy that project into a new folder on your computer
* Branches are pulled: when you pull a branch from GitHub it will create a new branch _inside_ the folder you have already cloned

This will take some practice to really wrap your head around and that's totally normal!

That's all the words for now, get studying!
